# Ideology Tracker

This is a simple command-line program that attempts to identify political leanings in a given phrase based on keyword matching.

It’s my first real programming project, built mostly as a way to test myself rather than to be particularly useful or polished.

## What It Does

- Takes user input
- Removes punctuation and converts the phrase to lowercase
- Compares words to a dictionary of ideologies with associated keywords
- Scores each ideology based on how many of its terms appear in the phrase
- Optionally shows the full list of scores
- Displays the ideology with the highest score

## What It Doesn't Do

- It does not interpret context or sentence structure
- It does not have a graphical user interface (UI)
- It’s not exactly pretty to look at
