This is a simple command-line program that attempts to identify political leanings in a give phrase based on keyword matching.
This is my first real programming project and it's mostly made with the intention of testing myself rather than being anything useful

What it does:
-Takes user input
-Removes punctuation and turns it all into lowercase
-Compares words to a dictionary of ideologies with keywords
-Scoes each ideology based on how many of its terms appear on the phrase
-Optionally shows the full list of scores
-Displays the ideology with the highest score

What it doesn't do:
-It does not interpret context or sentence structure
-It does not have an UI
-It's not exactly pretty to look at.
