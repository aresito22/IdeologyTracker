# IdeologyTracker 1.0
Enter a phrase and you'll see the closest matching political ideology

This is mostly a test as my first real project in Python--or any programming language for that matter.
It simply keeps track of terms in a given phrase and returns a matching ideology based on the amount and kind of terms used in the phrase.
It has no UI, it doesn't handle ties, and only recognizes words and not their context, so if you type in "I don't care about the workers and I dislike the idea of public ownership", it'll return the matching ideology as socialism.
